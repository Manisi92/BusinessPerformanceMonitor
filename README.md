# BusinessPerformanceMonitor

**BusinessPerformanceMonitor** is a Java-based application designed to monitor and analyze business performance metrics. The application is structured using a multi-layered architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability, with separate layers for Data Access Objects (DAO), models, services, and user interfaces (UI). This project is built using Maven, providing an easy-to-manage build process and dependency management.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular approach based on Maven, divided into several key layers:

- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the data source (such as databases). It handles all CRUD operations and provides a separation between the application logic and the underlying data structure.

- **Model**: This layer defines the business objects, data structures, and entities used throughout the application. It represents the core business logic and data formats.

- **Service**: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It coordinates between the DAO and the UI layers, implementing the core functionality needed to monitor and analyze performance metrics.

- **UI (User Interface)**: This layer handles the interaction with the user. It provides a graphical or command-line interface to present the performance metrics, allowing the user to interact with the application efficiently.

## Features

- Monitor and track business performance metrics.
- Customizable dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Scalable architecture, easily extendable with additional features and integrations.
- Multi-layer architecture for better code separation and maintainability.
- Easy integration with databases using DAO pattern.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **Java 8** or higher
- **Maven** for building the project and managing dependencies
- A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing performance data (configurable in the DAO layer)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BusinessPerformanceMonitor.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd BusinessPerformanceMonitor
```

### 3. Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 4. Run the application:

You can run the application directly through Maven or using your preferred IDE:

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

Alternatively, run the main class from your IDE.

## Configuration

The database connection settings can be configured in the `src/main/resources/config.properties` file. Modify the following parameters to match your database setup:

```properties
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/business_db
db.username=root
db.password=password
```
